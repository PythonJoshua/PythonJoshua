### Hello! I am a small, and not known developer who is learning website development, I have learnt python and my next goal is to learn java, as  I want to bring my skills to games like Minecraft, etc.

### How can you contact me? You can contact me on discord, I am sorry that it isn't easy to contact me, I generally cannot be bothered to setup a twitter account, or a email account just for use on Github and communication! Here is my discord tag: oasiiss#9066

### What projects do I work on? I am currently working on a private respitory, sorry you cannot see it, it is for my website: crystalaura.ga, however the websites currently down as I am trying to find a decent free host which allows different pages and not just one!
### The project may become open source once it works fully!

### This page will often be updated.
